Hack 4 Justice is a social justice hackathon toolkit. We're releasing our process of coordinating our event, FIX 216, so others may replicate. 

In this repo we we've documented what we (Hack Cleveland) learned and accomplished producing FIX 216.

Fix 216 was a civic hackathon that produced websites and apps that are facilitating open dialogue, idea generation, and awareness-building around public safety, excessive force and the Department of Justice consent decree in Cleveland, Ohio. 

The model for a social justice hackathon, like FIX 216, is replicable and we encourage other cities to host their own social justice hackathons. 

With FIX 216 #HackCLE focused on 1) presenting technology as a way to lift up the work of area residents and organizers and 2) making the case for activism to those who are unfamiliar. 


WHAT HAPPENED AT THE FIX 216 CIVIC HACKATHON MAY 29 & 30, 2015?

A diverse group of 100+ attendees came together to create 5 projects addressing various challenges facing Cleveland. The problems addressed were: 

Impact of more policing on community safety

Cost of implementing the consent decree

Consent decree request for increase police accountability, reporting and training without any tools to do so (especially ones that will allow community participation)

Limited community engagement in city decision making
